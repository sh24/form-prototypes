<strong>Our icon: the SH:24 colon,</strong>
distinguishes the constituent parts of our brand name: ‘Sexual health: 24 hours a day’.
So it helps to explain what we offer; but it also serves to make our name distinctive, consistent and recognisable — written in to
a sentence; printed at the top of a letterhead; or on the homepage of our website.
And it’s flexible: over time, it will be used to say other things too, and come to represent the values of our brand and service more broadly.
It has the potential to become a valuable asset and functional tool.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Our logo</strong> constitutes our colon icon, in combination with our name. Unless part of running text, it should appear as shown below, and never typed out, even in our brand font.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Our strapline</strong> spells out our brand name: helping new users understand how we can help them, faster.
</p>

<div class="tone-of-voice clearfix">
  <header>If you're worried<span class="sh24-colon">:</span> we're here to help.</header>
  <p><strong>Our writing style</strong> capitalises on the colon icon. We can use it to create a dialogue — a question and answer — accessible,
  and conversational, but also economical and to the point.</p>
